# Basic React Multi Page Site

My first project using React & Babel.

Using React to create HTML elements dynamically in JS, and Babel to compile the JS to work in the browser.

Babel converts files in the src/ directory to browser-compatible JS, and places them in the root directory. 
run watch script:
  npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod
